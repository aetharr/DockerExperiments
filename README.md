# DockerExperiments
Just a home for my collection of Dockerfiles and the like while I experiment with this crazy tool.

## General Pointlessness, But who can say honestly?
In this collection, the majority of the content will likely be quite pointless. But I figured that if I keep it on my computer, then one day I'll end up losing it and that'll be the end of it.

Instead, I plan to leave it on here as a sort of dumping ground, that if someone else just-so-happens to find useful, then that'd be a bonus.

There will probably be a focus on Raspberry Pi compatibility as that's the platform im trying to target with most of these as they're cheap to buy, cheap to run, nippy little machines.
